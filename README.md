# Practice

#### Introduction
This repository serves as a record of what I've learned in school, along with some personal practice. During my first year of college, I realized that my fundamental skills were lacking and that I tended to forget knowledge soon after exams. To enhance my basic computer science abilities, I've decided to write blogs. I hope not only to improve myself through this process but also to help others who might be facing similar challenges.
