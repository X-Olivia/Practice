# Practice

#### Introduction
This is a repository to record what I have learned in school and also some my own practice. During the first year in college, I found that my fundamental skills are not good enough and the knowledge always would be forgot after exam. So I want to improve my basic ability of CS through writing blogs. Hope I can be better in the future, and the note can help someone like me.
