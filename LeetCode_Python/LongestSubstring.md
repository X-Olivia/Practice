## Question

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**

Input: `s = "abcabcbb"`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

**Example 2:**

Input: `s = "bbbbb"`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

**Example 3:**

Input: `s = "pwwkew"`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.

Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

### Constraints:

- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.

## Analysis

The goal is to read characters one by one and store them in a list or similar structure. As each new character is read, we check if it already exists in the list:

- If it doesn't exist, we add it to the list.
- If it does exist, we update the maximum length (if the current length is greater), then adjust the list by removing characters up to the duplicate character.

Here's the initial approach:

```python
# Wrong approach
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        substring = []
        length = 0
        for c in s:
            if c in substring:
                if len(substring) > length:
                    length = len(substring)
                substring = []
            substring.append(c)
        return length
```

However, this approach has a flaw. For example, given "dvdf", the longest substring should be "vdf". The initial approach fails to handle this correctly because it simply clears the list upon finding a duplicate.

### Improved Approach:

Instead of clearing the list, we should remove elements up to the duplicate character and continue processing. Here's the corrected approach:

```python
# Correct approach
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        substring = []
        length = 0
        for c in s:
            if c in substring:
                if len(substring) > length:
                    length = len(substring)
                substring = substring[substring.index(c) + 1:]
            substring.append(c)
        if len(substring) > length:
            length = len(substring)
        return length
```

While this approach works, it can be further optimized. We can use a dictionary instead of a list to keep track of character indices, thus avoiding repeated length calculations and improving performance. Here is the optimized solution:

### Optimized Approach:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        start = 0
        length = 0
        dic = {}
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] in dic and dic[s[i]] >= start:
                start = dic[s[i]] + 1
            dic[s[i]] = i
            length = max(length, i - start + 1)
        return length
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `start`: The starting index of the current substring without repeating characters.
   - `length`: The length of the longest substring found so far.
   - `dic`: A dictionary to store the latest index of each character.

2. **Iterate through the string**:
   - For each character `s[i]` at index `i`:
     - If `s[i]` is already in `dic` and its stored index is greater than or equal to `start`, update `start` to be one position after the last occurrence of `s[i]`.
     - Update `dic[s[i]]` to the current index `i`.
     - Update `length` to be the maximum of the current `length` and the length of the current substring (`i - start + 1`).

3. **Tip**:
    - take care of this `if s[i] in dic and dic[s[i]] >= start:`condition
    
This approach ensures an O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the string, making it efficient and suitable for large input sizes.
