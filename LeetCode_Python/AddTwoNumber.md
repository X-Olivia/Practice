## Question

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.


## Analysis 
After reading the problem, two approaches come to mind. The first is to sequentially read each linked list to obtain two integers, add them, and then generate a new linked list from the result. The second approach is to directly add the numbers node by node, creating a new linked list as we go.

Let's start with the second approach. My initial implementation was somewhat cumbersome, but here is the initial code:

## Code

```shell 
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution(object):
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
        """
        :type l1: ListNode
        :type l2: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        new_list = ListNode()
        head_node = new_list
        carry = 0

        # Process both lists until one ends
        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val + l2.val + carry > 9:
                new_list.val = (l1.val + l2.val + carry) % 10
                carry = 1
            else:
                new_list.val = l1.val + l2.val + carry
                carry = 0
            l1 = l1.next
            l2 = l2.next
            if l1 or l2:
                next_node = ListNode()
                new_list.next = next_node
                new_list = new_list.next

        # Process remaining elements of l1
        while l1:
            if l1.val + carry > 9:
                new_list.val = (l1.val + carry) % 10
                carry = 1
            else:
                new_list.val = l1.val + carry
                carry = 0
            l1 = l1.next
            if l1:
                next_node = ListNode()
                new_list.next = next_node
                new_list = new_list.next

        # Process remaining elements of l2
        while l2:
            if l2.val + carry > 9:
                new_list.val = (l2.val + carry) % 10
                carry = 1
            else:
                new_list.val = l2.val + carry
                carry = 0
            l2 = l2.next
            if l2:
                next_node = ListNode()
                new_list.next = next_node
                new_list = new_list.next

        # Final carry check
        if carry == 1:
            next_node = ListNode(carry)
            new_list.next = next_node
        
        return head_node

```
## Optimize:

Next, let's optimize this code:

1.The redundant while loops for processing l1 and l2 can be merged into one main while loop.
2.The variable naming needs improvement for better clarity.

## Optiimized Code
```shell

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution(object):
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
        """
        :type l1: ListNode
        :type l2: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """

        new_list = ListNode()
        current = new_list
        carry = 0
        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            val1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
            val2 = l2.val if l2 else 0
            sum = val1 + val2 + carry
            carry = sum // 10
            current.val = sum % 10
            if l1:
                l1 = l1.next
            if l2:
                l2 = l2.next
            if l1 or l2 or carry:
                current.next = ListNode()
                current = current.next
        return new_list
```
